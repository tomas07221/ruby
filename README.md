# blockchain-ruby
My exercise to translate Daniel van Flymen brilliant post "Learn Blockchain by Building One" (https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) to Ruby.

#Installation & Dependencies
This version uses Sinatra as web framework, to install it:

gem install budler
bundle install

#To Do
* Include comments
* Separate Blockchain class from Sinatra implementation
* It needs some improvemnts, there are flaws in this implementation
